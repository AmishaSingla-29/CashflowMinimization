# CashflowMinimization
This project graphically shows the minimization of complex cashflows among a group of people in the form of directed graphs.  It outputs the set of minimum transactions to be carried out to resolve all debts within the group.It restructures debt within groups of people. It does not change the total amount that anyone owes, but it makes it easier to pay people back by minimizing the total number of payments. In this project, various random cashflow problems (graphical) and their minimized solutions can be generated just on a click.
